# Hackathon ideas

- RSS feed application
- Air Crash app which installs like a trojan (ofc as a feature) tracks IMU data,
  unfortunately no data for machine learning available unfortunately.
- Rocket tracker (livecast tracker)
- Inter cellular net communication (proof of concept, maybe JODEL replacement)
- FatBit (Like FitBit but it ensures that you eat at least one time per week junk food)
- New version of Deep Sky Stacker
- Overhead Sattelite Tracker
- Future traffic control simulator
- 2048 Terminal edition
- McEliece (probably way too much)
- keep working on trendcoin (actually not keep working but finally doing some neuronal network training :D)
- CLI podcast manager/player
- extension based application or task launcher
